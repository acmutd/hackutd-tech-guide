# Flask

JavaScript is not a one-tool-fits-all solution for all projects. Let us say you develop a machine learning model or a computer vision robot in [Python](https://www.python.org/). Now, you want to allow users to interact with your prototype through an online interface. The easiest solution would be to use a library such as [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) to turn your existing code into a web app.
