# Backend

Imagine you are building the Google search website. You have the search bar, buttons, etc., but how do we actually get the search results? This is where a **backend** comes in handy. **Backends** usually process data and perform calculations on a remote computer (server). The **backend** may be a server or many servers that send and recieve data from a database, run expensive algorithms, control user security and login, or all of these.
