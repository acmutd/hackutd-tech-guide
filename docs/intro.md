# Intro

Making a hackathon project can seem super scary and complicated, but after reading this guide, you'll be confident in making your own. Imagine we're building the Google Search website.
Most hackathon projects will want some sort of user interface - after all, you want the judges to be able to visualize your idea, right? Many projects also contain some sort of system that deals with data, whether that be user data or data from external sources. This guide explains and provides resources to learn about user interfaces and data driven systems. If you have no idea what you’re doing at a hackathon or need some links/templates for any of these topics, then you’re at the right place!

## The User Interface (Frontend)

User interfaces and the software behind them are also known as the **frontend**. Frontends are what users see and interact with. When you go to a website and log in, you're interacting with the **frontend** of that website. The term **frontend** describes the text, buttons, links, input fields, etc. on a webpage and the software that goes into creating and composing them. Imagine we are building the Google Search website. What parts of the Google Search website do users see and interact with? The first components that come to mind are the search bar, search buttons, profile icon, and logo. These components are what we describe as the **frontend**.

## Basic Concepts

**HTML** - If you look closely, you'll notice that all web pages have structure to them. **HTML** is a language that describes this structure. Does this button go before or after the title? Is this element grouped together with that element? Do we nest the paragraph inside of the table? Questions like this are answered using **HTML**, a simple tag-based language used on every website you open.

**CSS** - While **HTML** describes how a web page is structured, **CSS** is what gives it color, size, spacing, animations, etc. CSS is what sets apart boring looking websites from an [Apple webpage](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/).

**Javascript** - When you click on a button, what should your web page do? When you type words into a search bar, what results should come up? The code that runs dynamically on your website, the code that reacts to events, is written in **Javascript**.

# Data Driven Systems (Backend)

In most hackathon projects, this “data-driven system” comes in the form of a **backend**. Again, imagine you are building the Google search website. You have the search bar, buttons, etc., but how do we actually get the search results? This is where a **backend** comes in handy. **Backends** usually process data and perform calculations on a remote computer (server). The **backend** may be a server or many servers that send and receive data from a database, run expensive algorithms, control user security and login, or all of the abovethese.
