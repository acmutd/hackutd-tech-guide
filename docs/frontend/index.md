# Frontend

Frontends are what users see and interact with. When you go to a website and log in, you're interacting with the **frontend** of that website. The term **frontend** describes the text, buttons, links, input fields, etc. on a webpage and the software that goes into creating and composing them.

## Basic Concepts

**HTML** - If you look closely, you'll notice that web pages all have structure to them. **HTML** is a language that describes this structure. Does this button go before or after the title? Questions like this are answered by **HTML**.

**CSS** - While **HTML** describes how a web page is structured, **CSS** is what gives it color, size, spacing, animation, etc.

<Docs items={[{type: 'link', href: '/frontend/css', label: 'CSS'}]}/>

**Javascript** - When you click on a button, what should your web page do? When you type words into a search bar, what results should come up? These are questions using **Javascript**.
