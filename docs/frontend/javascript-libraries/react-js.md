## Additional Resources

### React-based Frameworks

**Next.js**: (What we used) Takes care of a lot of important features needed in a fully-functional frontend application

[Next.js by Vercel - The React Framework](https://nextjs.org/)

### Non-React Frameworks

**Vue.js**: More template-based framework, still pretty popular

[Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework | Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

**Angular.js**: Older and used by a lot of companies, but tends to require a lot more bloaty setup code imo but that’s probably better for companies (also uh Google killed it off January 2022…)

[AngularJS - Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework](https://angularjs.org/)

**Svelte:** Adds a compile step and updates the DOM directly (I haven’t used it before but seems cool + has a good set of libraries and community support)

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

**Preact**: A “smaller, faster React” — basically React but they removed a lot of the fancier features, leaving a more barebones but def smaller & faster library

[Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

### Styling

**Material UI**: Many pre-made components that easily integrate with React! (and only React)

[MUI: The React component library you always wanted](https://mui.com/)

**Tailwind**: CSS, completely embedded in the classname. Tailwind provides an extensive set of CSS classes that you can use immediately (eg. `w-4` = `width: 1rem`)

[Tailwind CSS - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.](https://tailwindcss.com/)

**Google Fonts**: Easily import fonts and icons into your website with a simple link; works with even plain HTML websites, easiest way to get fonts

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

**Flexbox Guide**: CSS Flexbox is useful for putting things where you want them as easily as possible

[A Complete Guide to Flexbox | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

**Grid Guide**: CSS Grid is the best tool for making grids :)

[A Complete Guide to Grid | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

### React Libraries

React.js has a MASSIVE community who have built components for basically anything you need. Google is your best friend for finding these libraries, but here is a list of libraries that I recommend:

**Redux:** helps you have a “global” state so you don’t have to pass state variables through a million components

[React Redux | React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)

### Miscellaneous

**Typescript**: Javascript but BETTER — it adds a [typing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type), which allows you to type check before deploying your code. It adds an extra translation step from TS → JS. (Highly recommend using this!)

[JavaScript With Syntax For Types.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
