# HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

## The Anatomy of HTML

HTML is made up of a bunch of tags. This is a tag:

You can nest tags inside each other and put them next to each other. Tags are displayed from left to right and top to bottom.

For example:

```HTML
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<a href="www.google.com"><strong>This is a bolded link.</strong></a>
```

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<a href="www.google.com"><strong>This is a bolded link.</strong></a>
